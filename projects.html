            <h3>PuyoJS</h3>
            <div>
            <div class="description">
                <p>The classic game of PuyoPuyo recreated in JavaScript! This game is one of my first tests with P5JS and has a few rough patches. The collision and nearby Puyo detection were an interesting challenges because they required me to think of it from a grid-based mindset instead of the more open methods common in game engines, such as Unity3D.</p>

            <h3>Form2Role Bot</h3>
            <div>
            <div class="description">
                <p>A Discord bot created to assign roles to students in a school Discord Server. The idea was that students would fill out a Google Form, then the bot would automatically assign them those roles so that each student had access to text channels for those classes. This would make it easy for them to ask questions and connect with others in the class.</p>
